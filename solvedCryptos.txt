THE OLD MAN WENT OUT TO BUY FLOWERS FOR HIS WIFE
AN ELEPHANT NEVER FORGETS
THE BUS IS ALWAYS RUNNING LATE
THE EARTH GOES ROUND THE SUN
LETS ALL GO TO THE BEACH TODAY
THE MUSIC AT THE FESTIVAL WAS VERY LOUD
I GOT ON A PLANE AT THE AIRPORT
FRANCE IS NICE THIS TIME OF YEAR
REMEMBER TO DRINK LOTS OF WATER
LOOK UP IT IS A FULL MOON TONIGHT
THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE
IF YOU SEE A CROCODILE DONT FORGET TO SCREAM
I CAN HEAR AN OWL HOOT AT NIGHT
IT HAS BEEN VERY HOT THIS YEAR
A QUICK FOX JUMPED OVER THE GARDEN HEDGE
